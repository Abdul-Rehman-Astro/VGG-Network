# VGG-Network
VGG- Network is a convolutional neural network model proposed by K. Simonyan and A. Zisserman in the paper “Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition” [1]. This architecture achieved top-5 test accuracy of 92.7% in ImageNet, which has over 14 million images belonging to 1000 classes.

It is one of the famous architectures in the deep learning field. Replacing large kernel-sized filters with 11 and 5 in the first and second layer respectively showed the improvement over AlexNet architecture, with multiple 3×3 kernel-sized filters one after another. It was trained for weeks and was using NVIDIA Titan Black GPU’s.
