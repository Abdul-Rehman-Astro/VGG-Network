# VGG-Network
VGG- Network is a convolutional neural network model proposed by K. Simonyan and A. Zisserman in the paper “Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition” [1]. This architecture achieved top-5 test accuracy of 92.7% in ImageNet, which has over 14 million images belonging to 1000 classes.
